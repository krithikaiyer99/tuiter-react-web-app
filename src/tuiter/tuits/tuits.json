It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars"

Each new Tesla vehicle is equipped with eight external cameras and powerful vision processing to provide an additional layer of safety. Model 3 and Model Y built for the European and Middle Eastern markets will now utilise our camera-based Tesla Vision, which are not equipped with radar and instead rely on Tesla’s advanced suite of cameras and neural net processing to deliver Autopilot and related features."
